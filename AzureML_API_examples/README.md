This folder contains some basic examples on how to interact with Azure ML. You
can use these as a starting point for your own development.

Enter the correct information about your AzureML workspace in `workspace.py`.
Upon the first operation you do, a browser window will open for authentication
with your user account.

In `get_path_from_dataset.py`, the blob storage API is used too. Some more
credentials must be filled in there. This is not required for any of the other
examples to work.

Note that the datasets and files as used in these examples were of my
experimenting Azure instance, and will therefore not be available for you.
Adjust as required.
