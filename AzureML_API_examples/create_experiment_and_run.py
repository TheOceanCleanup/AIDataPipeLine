# Create a new experiment, environment (uncontrolled in this case) and use these
# for a training run, using the 'images' dataset. It trains the model through
# the training script train/train.py.
#
# Note that the model that is being trained in the example is very basic and
# does not actually use the provided --regularization parameter, nor does it
# provide an actual performance result. These are merely hardcoded to show the
# effect in AzureML.
