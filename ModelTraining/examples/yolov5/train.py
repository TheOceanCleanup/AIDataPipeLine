# This is a skeleton file that you can use to implement a training script. This
# includes the functionality required to train a model and register the
# run in Azure ML.
#
# To use this, look for the parts marked with TODO - these need to be adjusted
# or filled in.
# A logging object is available - whatever is logged to this will be registered
# in Azure ML as logs of the model training. Don't confuse this with run.log(),
# that is used to register statistics about the model, both parameters and
# performance metrics.
